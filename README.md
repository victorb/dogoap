# Data-Oriented, Goal-Oriented Action Planning
> AKA DOGOAP - GOAP implemented in data-oriented way to facilitate dynamically setting up states/actions/goals rather than only at compile-time

> Includes bevy_dogoap which provides a neat Bevy integration of the dogoap library

## Documentation

- [`dogoap`](./crates/dogoap/README.md) docs - Standalone library for creation actions, states and goals to be used with the provided planner
- [`bevy_dogoap`](./crates/bevy_dogoap/README.md) docs - Integration of the `dogoap` library into Bevy

> Some resources if you want to read up on GOAP, STRIPS and related tech

## Prior Art / Other similar projects

- https://github.com/skyne98/soap - A lot of inspiration taken from this repository, biggest difference is the data-oriented structure that dogoap has
- https://github.com/dmackdev/bevy_goap - Native Bevy GOAP library, API interface isn't ideal though
